				<td class = project_info>I started this project for two reasons. First, I decided it would be an excelent project to hone my skills in C++. It gives me an excelent excuse to explore various
				quirks of the language and common design patterns. The second was to satisfy my natural curiosity. I'm the kind of person that loves to figure out the inner workings of
				things. There is no better way to learn than by doing. This project may never get finished but I can honestly say it was worthwile from all that I have learned</td>

				<td class = project_info>This was a group project that I worked on in College. We spent a semester building a video game using Unity. In the end, it was far from perfect but as a first foray
				into video game design, I think it went reasonably well. We kept a log of our work <a href = "https://thepunnyman.github.io/SpaceGame/" target = "_blank"><strong>Here</strong></a>. In the end, I was
				responsable for:
					<ul>
						<li>The Player Character Controls</li>

						<li>The Weapon System</li>
						<li>The Menus</li>
						<li>The Boss Character Sprites and AI</li>

				<td class = project_name>Florida Solar Beach Buggy Challenge</td>
				<td class = project_info>When I was a senior at the University of Central Florida we were required to complete a group project to graduate. We were given a list of problems from various
				companies that needed to be solved and we chose the ones that interested us the most. My project was an engineering challenge from UCF to construct a beach buggy capable
				of navigation and object avoidance. I worked with one other Computer Science Major to design the autonimouse system for a buggy built by a team of engineering majors. It
				was difficult for multiple reasons, many out of our control, but It was the greatest learning experience of my time at UCF. I taught myself about Python and The complexities
				of neural networks. I learned to use the Linux terminal extensively. I even learned a thing or two about the importance of backups when I corrupted our bootloader on accident.
				Dispite our various issues, I enjoyed ever minute of the project. I will personally vouge for the work ethic of my partener Tyler and the full Mechanical team. It was a 
				pleasure working with all of you.</td>
